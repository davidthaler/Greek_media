# Greek Media Multilabel Classification (WISE 2014)
This repository holds the code for the 10th place entry in the 
Greek Media Multi-label Classification competition hosted on Kaggle.
The competition page is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/wise-2014).   
  
## Description


## Requirements
* Python - this code was developed with Python 2.7
* Numpy/Scipy
* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) - 
All of the dependencies are available in the [Anaconda Python distribution]
(https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) for scientific computing.
* [Greek Media Data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/wise-2014/data) - The files needed are: 
  * wise2014-libsvm-test
  * wise2014-libsvm-train
  * sampleSubmission

The arff files have the same data as the libsvm files, but in a different format.
You will need to accept a set of competition rules (if you were not in the competition) before 
downloading.

## Set-up
The code assumes a directory structure under the project level of:  

* data/ - with the data from Kaggle  
* code/ - The name doesn't matter. This is where you clone to. 
* submissions/ - the code will write submissions here 

## Usage
The string constant BASE in util.py contains the path to the project level directory.
You will need to edit that to point to where you put this project.   

The data comes in libsvm format. The first step, which happens once, 
is to convert to array datatypes by running the rewriteData.py script.   

After that, a simple model that scores 0.769 on the final leaderboard 
can be generated by running the runOne.py script. This script runs the highest 
performing single model, the UniformOVA model, by itself. It should get 0.769 on the
final standings (also good for 10th) and it runs fairly quickly.   

The actual 10th place entry was an ensemble generated with models.StackModel. 
You can run that model instead by uncommenting the line (in runModel.py):
'''
model = StackModel(...   
'''   
and it should score 0.775. It will take a couple of hours to run.
